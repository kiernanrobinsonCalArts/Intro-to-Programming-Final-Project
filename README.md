# Intro-to-Programming-Final-Project

This code is fairly basic. It begins to play a video and audio when the mouse is pressed initially.
Additionally, it creates a number of "Branches" when clicked that spring out from the mouse position to cover the screen in random directions.

While I wanted to do more with this project I ended up overshooting what I was intially going to be able to do,
but do plan to expand project in the future as I get more time.
